1file -> 2nd file
Streams are abstract interfaces for working with streaming data in Node.js, allowing data to be processed in small chunks rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
This "chunk-by-chunk" processing makes streams highly efficient for handling large files, network communication, or real-time data feeds.
There are four main types of streams:
Readable Streams: For reading data (e.g., fs.createReadStream()).
Writable Streams: For writing data (e.g., fs.createWriteStream()).
Duplex Streams: Streams that are both readable and writable (e.g., net.Socket).
Transform Streams: Duplex streams that can modify or transform data as it flows through them (e.g., zlib.createDeflate)
